## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hieule123/My-profile-/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# My Interest In I.T 
I started to take in interest in I.T at the age of 5 when my father let me use his early 2000s laptop running windows XP. I can remember the first game I played was a flight simulator and ever since I after that I am constantly on it browsing and exploring taking deep interest on the “Internet”. After some time working, I have decided to go back to studies mainly to have a career that I am interest in. I have decided to study at RMIT because I heard good reviews through my friends on taking the course and he said that he has “learnt and improve skills and able to use programs/tools to develop applications”. I also did my own research on RMIT upon before taking the course and find that the instructor is nice and willing to help you excel. I am expecting to learn the basics of programming at the end of this course and getting the ideas of how codes are written in eclipse.
