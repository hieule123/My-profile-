# My Interest In I.T 
I started to take interest in I.T at the age of 5 when my father let me use his early 2000s laptop running windows XP. I can remember the first game I played was a flight simulator and ever since that, I am constantly on it browsing and exploring taking deep interest on the “Internet”. After some time working, I have decided to go back to studies mainly to have a career that I am interest in. I have decided to study at RMIT because I heard good reviews through my friends on taking the course and he said that he has “learnt and improve skills and able to use programs/tools to develop applications”. I also did my own research on RMIT upon before taking the course and find that the instructor is nice and willing to help you excel. I am expecting to learn the basics of programming at the end of this course and getting the ideas of how codes are written in eclipse.

# Test Results 
 
Myers-Briggs Indicator test results:
I learnt that my personality trait ISTJ charaistic makes up 9% of the population. Upon analyzing the results I've feel these Myers Briggs results really protray myself and what my values are. I was suprise how accurate and precise this test was in terms of who I am and makes me a hard working indiviual. According to results I am a dedicated and resposible, efficient, systematic, organized and reliable. These chararistic can benefit in a team enviroment centered around team work and collaborating. ISTJ are very organize and dedicated which is a essential to a succesful working enviroment in a team. 

Education Planner test results: 
After taking this test I find that I am tactile person who likes doing hands on things and learn better with physical activity involved. In terms how these results may influence my behaviour in a team will mainly aid if there team assessment/task is a physical and hands on one. I am best suited for practical tasks and roles, where others prefer reading and learning via books and studying. If I was to form a team, I would find others who were more suited for non-practical tasks so that the spread of the team was all round. I would dedicate the physical aspects of an assessment to myself and assign other non-practical tasks to my teammates. 

How-to-study.com Test 
According to the results, it informs me that I am a visual Learner, and that I tend to learn better visualizing an example first before perfecting it, the website encourages to include illustration as I take notes. This can influence my behavior in a team by having an example to improvise in order to create a goal vision. By being a visual learner, I feel that I can benefit a team by being able to create efficient and effective diagrams that can visualise concept maps and symbols to aid my teammates in reaching our goal at hand or team assessment. In regards to how this will effect forming a team, I am aware that in order for a team to be efficient and successful, there needs to be delegation of tasks and roles to different members of the team. As I am a visual learner, I feel that I can assign and diligently do the visual aspects of the tasks at hand while others work on the remaining parts of the tasks. 

# Project idea

Overview 
I want to create an app on both Android and IOS platform using the same server for the public to interact/updating real-time police locations and booze/drug busses. This involves users to update police locations warning others there are police in the area. If you're not on the application there will be a notification/alert that shows on your device. The purpose of this application will be to inform users of highly crowded police areas as this will safe time on your destination. Booze buses/drug trucks create congestion on main roads which causes traffic which weill delay your arrival time. By allowing users the option of avoiding these areas, overall congestion will be spread out and not as heavily populated especially during peak hour traffic times. 

Motivation
The main benefit that this will provide users and drivers would be an efficient and effective use for all drivers in suburban areas. This application will ensure that congestion on main roads during peak times is more controlled. Traffic on Melbourne roads and freeways are already heavily under scrutiny and traffic detection applications would be effective for monitoring and ensuring that these popular routes are free of further traffic. By providing users with the option of avoiding these congested areas, this will support other drivers by providing different routes to avoid over populated roads and streets that have drug buses stopping cars.
