# My background  
My name is Hieu, student number is s3660832. I am Vietnamese currently 21 years old working part-time in warehousing. I speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English fluently, my favourite hobbies are playing Pc games and working on Japanese cars, I also have German Shepherd as my companion pet, her name is Rexy and she is lovely. 

# My Interest In I.T 
I started to take interest in I.T at the age of 5 when my father let me use his early 2000s laptop running windows XP. I can remember the first game I played was a flight simulator and ever since that, I am constantly on it browsing and exploring taking deep interest on the “Internet”. After some time working, I have decided to go back to studies mainly to have a career that I am interest in. I have decided to study at RMIT because I heard good reviews through my friends on taking the course and he said that he has “learnt and improve skills and able to use programs/tools to develop applications”. I also did my own research on RMIT upon before taking the course and find that the instructor is nice and willing to help you excel. I am expecting to learn the basics of programming at the end of this course and getting the ideas of how codes are written in eclipse.
